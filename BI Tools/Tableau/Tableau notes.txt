Tableau notes
- Dimensions and Measures are 2 different roles
- Dimensions are text datatypes plus are independent variables as shows the region units were sold and measures numeric datatypes by default also dependent variables as its grouped by region
- Dashboard is a combo of stories
- Creation of a calculated field being total sales = [Units]*[Unit Price]
- To save the presentation to export as image or use the copy image 
- Can download the visuals under the Tableau public profile: Kirill Eremenko
- More dimensions increase granularity of the visualisation - per month for each gender
- Types of aggregation - sum, mean, median, variance
- Data discovery in Tableau can be done by utilising the highlight features for the charts
- Joining of the data sources at the physical layer
- Creating relalationships for the data sources at logical layer
- Highlighting vs Filtering
- Highlighting - dataset is not filtered but everything is present and relevant data is highlighted
- Filtering - filters the dataset thus allows one deconstruct the scatterplot
- Blending data vs Joining data
- Blending data - when data sources are different and level of granularity defers
- Joining data - when the relationships exists in the tables to show commonality
- Parameters can substitute bins
